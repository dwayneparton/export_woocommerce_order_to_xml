# Export Woocommerce Order to XML
A template for exporting each woocommerce order to it's own XML file. This is just a template to get the job done. You'll want to make the XML match your own needs.
Creates an XML file for each order when it's created along with a file for the customer.
## Uses
Maybe useful if a POS checks for files to sync orders with. Doesn't seem like the best method to me but needed it for one site.
